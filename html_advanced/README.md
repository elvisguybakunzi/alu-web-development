 # Advanced HTML 
 This is ALU project for Web development 

 Advanced HTML is a set of features that go beyond the basic syntax of HTML. These features can be used to create more complex and interactive web pages.

 It involves incorporating additional elements, attributes, and coding practices to enhance the functionality, aesthetics, and user experience of a website.

 ## Features of Advanced HTML

 * __Semantic Markup__: Advanced HTML emphasizes the use of semantic elements to  provide meaningful structure to web content. Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, and others help define the purpose and role of different parts of a webpage, aiding accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).

```html
    
    <header>
    
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    
    <nav>
    
        <ul>
    
          <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    
          <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
    
          <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
    
          <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
    
        </ul>
    
    </nav>
    
    </header>

    <section>
      <article>
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
        <p>Article content goes here.</p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2023 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>

```

* Multimedia Integration: Advanced HTML allows for seamless integration of multimedia elements such as images, audio, video, and animations. HTML5 introduced native support for video and audio tags, reducing the reliance on third-party plugins like Flash. This enables developers to create rich media experiences directly within the HTML code.

```html
    
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

    <video controls>
      <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

    <audio controls>
      <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      Your browser does not support the audio tag.
    </audio>

    <canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>

    <svg width="200" height="200">
      <circle cx="100" cy="100" r="50" fill="red" />
    </svg>  

```

* Forms and Input Handling: Advanced HTML enables the creation of interactive forms and provides more control over form elements. Developers can use various input types (text, email, number, date, etc.) and attributes (required, pattern, min/max values, etc.) to validate and process user input, enhancing the usability and data integrity of web forms.

```html

    <form>
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" required>

        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" required>

        <label for="message">Message:</label>
        <textarea id="message" required></textarea>

        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>

```

* Canvas and SVG Graphics: HTML5 introduced the `<canvas>` element, which allows for dynamic rendering of graphics and animations using JavaScript. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) can also be embedded in HTML documents, providing a resolution-independent and interactive way to display vector-based graphics.

```html
    <canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
```



* Accessibility Considerations: Advanced HTML promotes accessibility by encouraging the use of proper semantic elements, providing alternative text for images, using appropriate headings, and adhering to accessibility standards. These practices help ensure that websites are usable and inclusive for users with disabilities.
